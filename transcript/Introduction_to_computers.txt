Welcome to Tutorials Point. In this module we are going to cover the basics of computer. So let's first understand what computers are. Computer literally means to calculate. But the modern day computers which are all pervasive in our life mean much more than calculating. In fact, if we want to give a formal definition of computer, then computer is an electronic device that receives input, stores or processes the input as per the instructions given by the user and gives an output. That brings us to the input process output model of the computer. Here, as you can see, this is the simplest workflow of computer that I have drawn for you. An input is given which is processed and an output is given. Computer input is called data. Any raw information, raw facts, figures are called data. This data is processed upon by the computer. How this processing is done. This processing is done as per the instruction given by the user and depending on the process that is applied, an output is given. Let's take a small example. For example, I want to add two numbers, say two plus three. So what I will input, I will input the two numbers two and three and I will input the arithmetic operation that I want to do, which is addition. What is the process that will be done by the computer? Addition two plus three will be done by the computer. And what is the output that will be given to us? It will be five. So two plus three is equal to five. This whole process has been done by the computer. So this brings us to the processes that can be applied to the data are of two types arithmetic and logical arithmetic. An example I have given you just now addition, subtraction, multiplication. What are logical operations? If I want to compare something I give two numbers and I ask the computer to say which is greater. So I give the same two numbers, two and three. But my instruction is compare to two numbers and tell me which is greater. So it will tell me the answer as three. So that will be a logical operation. This is the actual model of the computer. The block diagram. We have an input unit here and we have an output unit here. However, the processing unit has three separate units the arithmetic logic unit, the control unit and the memory unit. Let's see how all these basic parts of computer are functioning. The input unit it consists of the devices that are used to give data or instructions to the computer. The control unit. The control unit is collaborating with all the devices and it controls the function of all the parts of the computer. The arithmetic logic unit it carries out all the arithmetic operations and logical comparisons. The memory, all the input data, instructions, output the interim data is stored in the memory unit and finally the output unit. The devices that are used to give us output are the output unit. The memory is of two types primary memory and secondary memory. Input unit could be your keyboard or mouse. The output unit could be your printer or your monitor. These are some of the things that you should keep in mind about a computer. The control unit, the arithmetic logic unit and the memory unit are together called the CPU or the central processing unit. Computer devices that we can touch and feel like a keyboard, a monitor, a mouse are called the hardware components of the computer. Besides the hardware component, a computer also has software. What is a software set of instructions or programs that make the program run? Make the computer run the instructions that we are giving to the computer they form the software of the computer. So in this video we have understood what the computer is. In the next video we are going to look at the features of computer.
