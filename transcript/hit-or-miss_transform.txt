You today we will be talking about hitomis transform. So we have already seen the terms hit and miss when we study dilation and erosion in morphological operations. In this topic too, the hit and miss terms are used in the same context, so we'll look more into hetermis transform. The morphological transform is a basic tool for shape detection. It is used in image processing and computer vision to detect specific patterns or shapes within binary images. It is particularly useful for detecting objects with a predefined shape and spatial configuration. So if we already know the shape and a spatial configuration of an object, we can use this heteromous transform to detect whether it is present in a binary image or not. So this operation involves the use of two structuring elements. They are called the heat element and the miss element. The heat element represents the shape or pattern to be detected and the miss element represents the complement of the pattern of the shape. The heteromist transform works by comparing the binary image with the hit and miss elements. So how it works is that for each pixel in the image, the heat element is centered on that pixel and the pixels of the image covered by the heat element are compared to the corresponding pixels in the heat element. And similarly for the missile element two, it is centered on the pixel and the pixels covered by the missile element are compared. So if the heat element matches the pixels in the image and the missile element does not, then the corresponding pixel in the output image is set to one. That is, it will be a foreground pixel, otherwise it will be set to zero and it is going to be a background pixel. This process is actually repeated for every pixel in the image and the resulting output image highlights the locations where the decide pattern or shape is present. So after repeating this process, the output that we get is an image in which the position where our decide shape is located is highlighted. So this hitomis transformation is represented by this equation. So this can be represented as a erosion b one intersection complement of a erosion b two. B one and b two are two structuring elements and b one is the hit element and b two is the miss element. So we will look further into it with the help of an example. So here we have an image A. As you can see, A is a binary image and this is the shape that we have to find if it exists inside A or not. So we are going to see if this shape here is present inside this binary image A. So for that, we first need two structuring elements b one and b two. B one is the hit element and b two is the miss element. So if you look closer, you can see that b one is in the shape of the elements with value one and b one is the background pixels of the shape. So b one corresponds to the foreground pixels of the shape and b two corresponds to the background pixels of the shape. So in the equation we saw that first we have to find a erosion p one. So that is what we are going to find first. So we have already studied how erosion and dilation works. So I'm not going to explain that. But here I've just highlighted the parts where the heat element fits over binary image A perfectly. So here you can say that the one element, the pixels with the value one of the hit element actually overlaps with the a. And all the pixels overlapping are also one. So in this position we have a hit. In this position two, we have a hit. And here too, we have a match. So we have highlighted those three pixels in the output of a erosion b one. So this is the output of a erosion b one. Similarly, now we are going to find the complement of A eroded by b two. B two is the miss element. So just like how we did a erosion b one, we are also going to be going to do a complement eroded by b two. This is actually b two. So after eroding, after the erosion process of the A complement, using the b two element, we will get this image as the output. So now we are going to find the intersection of a erosion b one and a complement erotic by b two. So the intersection, in the intersection of those two images, we will get these two pixels with the value one. So if we are going to check in the original image that is A, you can see that this particular shape exists here and also here. And these are the two pixels that we got in the final output. These two pixels are the output that we got. And at these two positions we have our shape. So the two positions where the shape exists is identified. This hitonis transform is a powerful tool for pattern matching and object detection. And it can also be, and it is usually used for tasks such as edge detection, feature extraction, et cetera. So that's all about a hit or miss transform. Thank you.
