A submersible vessel which takes people to see the wreck of the Titanic has gone missing in the Atlantic Ocean. There's a major search and rescue operation underway with the race to find the vessel before oxygen runs out. The Titanic sank back in 1912 and it lies some twelve and a half thousand feet beneath the surface. Five people were on board the Mini sub and the rescue is being organized in Boston for from, where our correspondent Jessica Parker reports. Now designed to plunge the depths of the ocean, this is the Titan submersible now missing in the North Atlantic. After contact with the vessel was lost, it sparked a frantic but complicated search. If it's on the bottom, particularly if it's very deep, it's going to be very difficult to rescue it. None of the conventional submarine rescue methods, which are designed mainly for naval submarines, would be able to operate down at the depth of the Titanic. Even if it could get down there, the hatches would not mate onto the submarinersville. A ship carrying the sub left Newfoundland and arrived at the wreck site on Sunday, where it then began its journey towards the seabed. But after an hour and 45 minutes, contact was lost. The sub itself is 7 meters long and can carry up to five people, typically a mix of crew and paying passengers. There's said to be enough oxygen for four days. It is a challenge to conduct a search in that remote area, but we are deploying all available assets to make sure that we can locate the craft and rescue the people on board. In a statement, Ocean Gate said it's exploring all options to bring everyone back safely. The British businessman and explorer Hamish Harding is believed to be among those on board. Slowdown through the just in front of us. This is what people pay the company. Ocean Gate expeditions nearly 200,000 pounds for a rare and extraordinary view of the Titanic, which has sat nearly 4000 meters beneath the ocean's surface for more than a hundred years. Now an expedition to find this hidden history has itself gone missing. Tonight an international search operation is underway 900 miles off this coast in a very remote area. Now of course, the focus is to try and find the vessel, whether it's now on the surface of the water or underneath. They're using aircraft, they're using sonar technology, but if the vessel is still underwater, that's when things get particularly difficult. And because of the limited oxygen supply, there would also be a limited time in which to find them. Jessica, many thanks once again for the update there Jessica Parker, our correspondent in Boston.
